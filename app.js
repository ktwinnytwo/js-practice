/* OOP

Example:
say you create a class for Color.
If you create a new color class:

const logoColor = new Color('emerald', [46,204,113])

Now you have access to the methods in the Color class.
It contains methods to let you do the following:
 - calculate the opposite color
 - calculate the hex code for the color
 - give you a slightly lighter version of your color
 - give you a slightyl darker version of your color

 Now everytime you create a new class of Color, all of them will have
 access to the methods in that class.
